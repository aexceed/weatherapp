# My documentation

Having none of the required software installed I had to start with that. First I wrote docker for windows into search and clicked the first link and installed it. Unable to start Docker I had to enable virtualization in my BIOS settings. I restarted computer, pressed DEL and entered BIOS settings. There I enabled Intel virtualization and saved settings. Restarting my computer I was still unable to access Docker because I was missing virtualization software so I had to install something for that. I chose VirtualBox since I have previous experience with that. Googled VirtualBox, clicked downloads and there Windows hosts and it installed it. Now my Docker was able to start and I made an account for it.
