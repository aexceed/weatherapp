# My documentation

Having none of the required software installed I had to start with that. First I wrote docker for windows into search and clicked the first link and installed it. Unable to start Docker I had to enable virtualization in my BIOS settings. I restarted computer, pressed DEL and entered BIOS settings. There I enabled Intel virtualization and saved settings. Restarting my computer I was still unable to access Docker because I was missing virtualization software so I had to install something for that. I chose VirtualBox since I have previous experience with that. Googled VirtualBox, clicked downloads and there Windows hosts and it installed it. Next it complained about Linux kernel not being up to date so I googled the problem and opened cmd.exe as admin and entered: wsl --update after which it updated my kernel. Now my Docker was able to start and I made an account for it.

Next up I decided to continue my work with this thing aka GitHub since I intend to return my work here. Logged into my old account and made weatherapp repo. I downloaded git bash for Windows since I figured it would be easier to use with their own commandline. After messing with the installing options and choosing the ones I like it started to install. My computer being the mess it is I decided to clone the assignments repo to my downloads folder. I went into the folder and right clicked open GIT Bash here. I went into the assignments repo, clicked code and there the https clone link.

Entered command $ git clone https://github.com/eficode/weatherapp.git to get the files to my computer. Next up I wanted to put the repo into my own github so It´s there and ready to be returned. Enter command $ git remote rename origin upstream to remove the link to the original repo and $ git remote add origin https://github.com/aexceed/weatherapp.git to add mine as the future reference. Now I want to push it to my repo to see if it´s there and make my life easier being able to see the whole thing. Change it from master to main, enter command: $ git branch -m main and to push it to my repo: $ git push -u origin main. It wanted my account credentials which I gave but error came up.

Something about support for password authentication being removed so now I needed to figure workaround for it. Little bit of googling and I found out you can make personal access token to use instead of password and then it will work. Click Account -> settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens. I chose fine grained token, gave it some name and in permissions I gave it permission to push to repo. Enter the command again and now in password screen I copied the token key and it worked pushing repo from my computer to GitHub.
